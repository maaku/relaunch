# relaunch

Relaunch is a library crate for bundling and relaunching macOS applications, in order to access OS features that are only available to app bundles and not command-line applications.

For information on how to use `relaunch`, check out the [examples](examples) directory and the cargo docs.

The original idea for `relaunch` and a few implementation ideas come from the [fruitbasket](https://github.com/mrmekon/fruitbasket) crate by Trevor Bentley.  This work represents a complete reimplementation by Mark Friedenbach, and is made available under the terms of the Mozilla Public License 2.0.
